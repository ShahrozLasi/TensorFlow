However, there does exist some other recurrent layers (layers that contain a loop) that work much better than a simple RNN layer. The one we will talk about here is called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This layer works very similarily to the simpleRNN layer but adds a way to access inputs from any timestep in the past. Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear. \n","\n","For the purpose of this course we will refrain from going any further into the math or details behind how these layers work."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JOzlbRKvpFsE","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Sentimental Analysis\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bdTGp1zJpRxC","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":84},"outputId":"f56a01e0-73ba-4e15-fe3e-83535828ebf5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584469211950,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":7847,"user":{"displayName":"shahroz lasi","photoUrl":"","userId":"12196692998240518202"}}},"source":["%tensorflow_version 2.x\n","from keras.datasets import imdb\n","from keras.preprocessing import sequence\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import os\n","import numpy as np\n","keras = tf.keras\n","\n","VOCAB_SIZE = 88584\n","\n","MAXLEN = 250\n","BATCH_SIZE = 64\n","\n","(train_data, train_labels), (test_data, test_labels) = imdb.load_data(num_words = VOCAB_SIZE)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["TensorFlow 2.x selected.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Using TensorFlow backend.\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["Downloading data from https://s3.amazonaws.com/text-datasets/imdb.npz\n","17465344/17464789 [==============================] - 1s 0us/step\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"azeuRM2AqFpC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#### More Preprocessing\n","\n","If we have a look at some of our loaded in reviews we'll notice that they are different lengths.
